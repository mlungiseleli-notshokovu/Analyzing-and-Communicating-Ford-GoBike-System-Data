## Dataset

I chose the Ford GoBike 201902 dataset. It includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.

Here is a link to the data source: 'https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/October/5f91cf38_201902-fordgobike-tripdata/201902-fordgobike-tripdata.csv'


## Summary of Findings

- Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate exploration wwas used to derive insights.

- The raw data took alot of time to explore and wrangle. However, that helped to developing questions and picking the right columns to to answer them
- Between Customer and Subscribers, the following findings were quite interesting:
    - Customers have the highest trip duration, but Subscribers are more consistent with bike trips throughout the week.
    - There is usually an increase of customers over the weekend compared to weekdays
    - Age seems to be a determining factor for trip duration. The younger you are, the higher the trip duration


## Key Insights for Presentation

In the analysis, I was able to find different relationships between user types, trip duration, and age.

I was also able to note some key insights including the following:
- There is usually an increase of customers over the weekend compared to weekdays
- Age seems to be a determining factor for trip duration. The younger you are, the higher the trip duration

In addition, I believe there is still far more analysis needed over a longer period in order to properly derive useful insights.
